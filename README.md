# Machine Learning Project Portfolio

This repository includes several beginner-to-intermediate level machine learning projects built with real-world datasets.  
The goal of each project is to practice and demonstrate the use of classic ML algorithms including classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation.

## Projects

### Project 1: Titanic - Survival Prediction
**Objective:** Predict whether passengers survived or not.  
**Models Used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

### Project 2: House Price Prediction
**Objective:** Predict house prices based on various features.  
**Models Used:**
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor

### Project 3: Cancer Diagnosis (Classification - Breast Cancer)
**Objective:** Classify whether cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).  
**Models Used:**
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### Project 4: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
**Objective:** Group customers into segments based on similar behavior.  
**Model Used:**
- KMeans Clustering

### Project 5: Movie Plot Recommendation Engine
**Objective:** Recommend movies based on plot similarity using NLP techniques.  
**Models/Techniques Used:**
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Cosine Similarity

### Project 6: News Topic Modeling
**Objective:** Discover hidden topics in a collection of news articles.  
**Models/Techniques Used:**
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### Project 7: Telco Customer Churn Prediction
**Objective:** Predict whether a customer will churn based on service usage and demographics.  
**Models Used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

Each project has its own folder containing:
- Dataset (in the `/data` directory)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Python 3.x with common ML libraries:  
`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`, `nltk`
