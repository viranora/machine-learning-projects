# Machine Learning Project Portfolio

This repository includes four beginner-level machine learning projects built with real-world datasets. The goal of each project is to practice and demonstrate the use of classic ML algorithms including classification, regression, and clustering.

## Projects

## 🔍 Project 1: Titanic - Survival Prediction 

**Objective:** Predict whether passengers survived or not.

**Models Used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
  
## 🏠 Project 2: House Price Prediction

**Objective:** Predict house prices based on various features.

**Models Used:**
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
  
## 🧬 Project 3: Cancer Diagnosis (Classification - Breast Cancer)

**Objective:** Classify whether cells are cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign).

**Models Used:**
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
## 🛍️ Project 4: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

**Objective:** Group customers into segments based on similar behavior.

**Model Used:**
- KMeans Clustering

Each project has its own folder containing:
- Dataset (in the `/data` directory)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Requirements
Python 3.x with common ML libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
